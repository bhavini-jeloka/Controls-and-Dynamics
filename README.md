The folder consists of a code for the Euler's rigid body equations using rotation matrices (a file for that is present as well) and these equations have been tested on a cube  (using 3D animation) which was drawn using the functions available on Matplotlib.

So far only constant torques have been incorporated - time varying ones would have a unique code, not a generalised one

PLEASE NOTE: For the files which involve a graph, the empty plot opens as soon as the code runs - this must be crossed off for letting the code run further (it works properly after that)
